# This file contains the code for the interactive web app that allows a user to select a stock pair, see cointegration stats and spread/z-score plots,
# simulate and visualize backtest results with adjustable thresholds and slippage, and use sliders for entry/exit z-test scores, holding period maxes, and 
# slippage/txn cost. This web app is built using Streamlit.
